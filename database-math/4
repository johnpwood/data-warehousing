John, here's the definition of the generalized product that
you'll probably want if you're coming back here:
The generalized product is taken of a set-valued function, F.
it is the set of functions, call each function f, such that
the domain of f is the domain of F and for all c f(c) is an
element of F(c).


1. How many distinct binary relations can be constructed from a
given set A with cardinality 3 to a given set B with cardinality 4?

The number of distinct pairs of elements is 12.  A binary relation
is any collection of these pairs, so the number of distinct collections
is 12! or 479,001,600.


2. How many distinct functions can be constructed from a given set A
with cardinality 3 to a given set B with cardinality 4?

The distinct domains of all these functions are the distinct collections
of elements of A.  Their number will be 2^3 - 1 or 7.  These should
be devided up by size:
three domains of size 1, three of size 2, one of size 3.
the numer of possible assignments of values to a function from
A to be will be 4 for each element of the domain, leading to this number
of possibilities:
domain size 1: 4
domain size 2: 4x4 = 16
domain size 3: 4x4x4 = 64
total number of possibilities: 84

3. 4. 5. 6.

7. Give the result sets for the following expressions

a. generalized product of { (a;{1}), (b;{1,2}) }

{ {(a; 1), (b; 1)}, {(a; 1), (b; 2)} }

b. generalized product of:
{ (a;{1, 2, 3, 4}), (b; {5, 6, 7, 8}), (d;null), (e; {9,10}) }

null

c. The set of all t such that t is a member of the generalized
product of { (a; {1, 2, 3, 4}), (b; {5, 6, 7, 8}) } and
t(a) + t(b) < 8

{
  {(a; 1), (b; 5)}, {(a; 2), (b; 5)},
  {(a; 2), (b; 5)}
}

d. The set of all f such that f is in the generalized product of
{ (X; {1, 2}), (Y; {1, 2, 3}) } and cardinality of the range of f
is 1.

{ {(X; 1), (Y; 1)}, {(X; 2), (Y; 2)} }
